# excess-deaths-in-Sweden

An analysis of registry death data made public by SCB. The results and visualization of the analysis is posted on my [blog](http://www.arvidharder.com/post/excess-deaths-in-sweden/).

The data used in the blogpost was downloaded from https://www.scb.se/om-scb/nyheter-och-pressmeddelanden/overdodligheten-fortsatter-att-sjunka-efter-toppen-i-april/. Every week an updated version of death registry data is released.
